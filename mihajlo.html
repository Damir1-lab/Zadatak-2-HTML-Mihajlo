    <p><b>Mihajlo Idvorski Pupin, Ph.D., LL.D. (Serbian Cyrillic: Михајло Идворски Пупин; 9 October
         1858 – 12 March 1935), also known as Michael I. Pupin, was a Serbian American physicist and physical chemist.</b> 
<br><br>
            Pupin is best known for his numerous patents, including a means of greatly extending the range of long-distance
             telephone communication by placing loading coils (of wire) at predetermined intervals along the transmitting
              wire (known as "pupinization"). 
            <br><br>
            Pupin was a founding member of National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) on March 3, 1915, which later
             became NASA.</p>
